A simple program that validates the PESEL number for a pawnshop. The program asks for a PESEL number, the client puts it in the console, then the program:
1. Checks if PESEL is correct (check sum compatible with the government side), if not, the program ends. Checks the length of the number and the checksum.
2. Verifies the age of the client. If the person is underage, the program tells in how many years he will be and when he can come back. If he is of legal age, the program goes on.
3. Asks the client what he wants to sell. If the goods are not on the blacklist (BlackList class), it offers the price for the goods. If the product is on the black list, the program informs that we do not deal with this stuff.
