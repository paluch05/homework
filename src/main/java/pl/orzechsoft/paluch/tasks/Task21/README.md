In this program I've got Person class. I had to implement a method:
1. Which has a List with names
2. Using stream() will make another List<Person> 'persons' from previous list with names and assign every person random age between 15 to 23
3. Using stream() makes from 'persons' Set<Person> 'adults' only with adults (18+)
4. Using stream() for each person will display "XXX is YYY years old" where XXX is name and YYY is age.
