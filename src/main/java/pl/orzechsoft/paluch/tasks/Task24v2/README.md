In this task I had to implement class that resembles a bank account. This class has 4 methods: 
1. 'doubleGetBalance()' which will take currnet balance account
2. List<Operation> getLastOperations(int n) which returns list with n last operations
3. void deposit(double amount, String name) which will add some funds
4. void withdraw(double amount, String name) wich will withdraw some funds.
Program has few threads which use this class, make some operations and wait for a moment.
